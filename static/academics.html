    <h1>Academics</h1>
    <p>
      I work with Greater Seattle students to encourage scholastic success and promote
intellectual growth. As a professional educator, I’ve experience with teaching:
    </p>
    <div class="centerlist">
    <ul>
      <li>English to urban Peruvian teenagers</li>
      <li>Science and History to gifted 5th graders</li>
      <li>Ski Instruction for all ages</li>
      <li>Weekly seminars on positive psychology for adults</li>
      <li>3000+ hours of personal tutoring</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <p>
      I believe how one learns is equally as important as what one learns. Therefore, when working
with my clients, I maximize their potential by teaching them how the brain really works. Successful student psychology is about employing smart strategies and adopting helpful minsets.
