        <h3>Life in General:</h3>
        <p>Is greater happiness your No. 1 goal?</p>
          <p>I spent three years researching and writing about the science of positive emotions, followed by a year teaching this content in weekly seminars. What I have to offer is a mountain of empirically valid ideas that you will find both understandable and actionable.</p>
          <p>Then, having established what to do, we'll shift gears and work on how on how to do it consistently.
        </p>

        <h3>Behavioral Change:</h3>
        <p>
          Are you struggling to implement the advice of your doctor or therapist? Having difficulty getting yourself to do the homework assigned by your physical or occupational therapist?
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been there. I figured out and got myself to do the work to regain my health. I will coach you on how to do the things you know you're supposed to do. My coaching makes an excellent supplement to these traditional healthcare services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there a good habit you'd like to start or a bad habit you'd like to quit?
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been there, too. I teach proven strategies that are backed by scientific research as well as my own experience. I'll also make sure you're approaching this change effort with helpful mindsets rather than the counterproductive attitudes that are, unfortunately, all-too-common.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you held back by procrastination or perfectionism?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll help you get started, keep going, and feel good about the proress you're making.
