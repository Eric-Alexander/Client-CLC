    I help people and organizations clarify their goals, find solutions, and get things done. I do this by weaving together modern neuroscience, social psychology, and real-world experience. Everything I have to offer is based on how the human brain actually works.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that the fundamentals of nutrition, sleep, and exercise form the foundation of success and happiness. Everything is easier when we take care of brain health.

  </p>
  <p>
    	I know that change is possible, but I also know that change is hard. This sort of realistic optimism encourages people to make the effort to change and also prepares them for the obstacles that will inevitably get in their way. Because of self-perception, action is the main driver of personal growth.

    True confidence comes from the acquisition of knowledge and the development of skills, so our focus will not merely be on feeling better, but on actually becoming better. Instead pumping up your self-esteem, I focus on helping you grow your self-efficacy and become an active agent in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is critical to have both a growth mindset and a spectrum mindset, which means embracing mistakes as learning opportunities and celebrating every step in the right direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a knack for translating important technical concepts, such as neuroplasticity and deliberate practice, into understandable metaphors, like the brain is a bunch of muscles. This makes key ideas much easier to remember and put into action.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has become clear to me over the years that it is foolish to rely on raw willpower when there are numerous strategies that make lifeâ€™s challenges easier. One such strategy is tapping into the power of feedback loops to build momentum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, because we are all imperfect, I believe it is necessary to grant both yourself and others permission to be human.
